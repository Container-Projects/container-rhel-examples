## Starter-systemd RHEL-based Image w/ best practices 
This image aims to include Red Hat's most critical [container best practices](http://docs.projectatomic.io/container-best-practices/).

### Building an image on RHEL
The easiest way to get started building your own rhel-based image is to first ensure you're using Red Hat's supported docker package on a registered RHEL7 or Atomic Server.

Be sure you've enabled the following repos after your system is registered:
```shell
$ subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
```
Install the docker package (after you've removed any public bits you may have been using):
```shell
$ yum install docker
$ systemctl enable docker
$ systemctl start docker
$ docker info
```
If access to a licensed RHEL/Atomic server is not available to you, we offer a no-cost Developer license as well as a Container Development Kit.

Once your host is setup you can begin your Dockerfile with this example. This will ensure you're using the supported/secure base image instead of one you might find on docker's public hub, and many other benefits discussed in the best practices link above.
```shell
$ docker build --pull -t acme/starter-systemd -t acme/starter-systemd:v3.2 .
$ atomic run acme/starter-systemd
# OR (on RHEL docker)
# $ docker run -tdi --name starter-systemd -p 8080:80 acme/starter-systemd
# OR
# $ docker run -tdi --name starter-systemd -p 8080:80 -v /sys/fs/cgroup:/sys/fs/cgroup:ro --tmpfs /run --tmpfs /tmp acme/starter-systemd
$ docker logs starter-systemd 
$ docker exec starter-systemd systemctl status
$ docker exec starter-systemd journalctl
```
### Running in OpenShift
```shell
$ oc new-project systemd
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user anyuid -z default

# deploy rhel7 image
$ oc create -f systemd-ocp-template.yaml

# OR deploy centos7 image
# oc create -f systemd-ocp-template-centos7.yaml

$ oc new-app --template=systemd-httpd
```
